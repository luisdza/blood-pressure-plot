The goal of plotbloodpressure is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of plotbloodpressure from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("plotbloodpressure")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("luisdza/plot-blood-pressure")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(plotbloodpressure)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r bloodpressuremeasurements}
summary(bloodpressuremeasurements)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
plot(bloodpressuremeasurements)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
